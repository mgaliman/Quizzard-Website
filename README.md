This is a project made by five students, with the help and guidance of their professors, from Algebra University College in Zagreb, Croatia.

It is a Node.js web application that enables its users to create quizzes and play them with others in real-time.
We use Express.js as our backend web application framework.
It uses a Microsoft SQL Server client for Node.js to connect with a database and store information.
We use bcryptjs, cookie-parser, jsonwebtoken middleware to safely store and handle sensitive information.
We use Body-parser middleware to parse the information from clients' requests into JSON format.
We use hbs module as our template engine to display information from servers to clients.
we use Socket.IO library to enable real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the client and the server.
We use nodemailer module to enable email sending.
